Project Description
A gloriously useless waiting screen that combines a loading bar, an evasive skip button, a cute random cat viewer, and a playable Flappy Bird game ‚Äî all while an endlessly looping YouTube Shorts video plays in the background.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Waiting screens are boring. Seriously, why stare at a bland progress bar when you could be entertained, baffled, or mildly frustrated by an elusive skip button and some pixelated birds?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a loading screen that refuses to be ignored! It entertains with bouncing ‚ÄúLOADING‚Ä¶‚Äù text, tempts you with a skip button that runs away, distracts you with random cats, and challenges you to Flappy Bird ‚Äî all while you "wait" for nothing in particular.
